if the bot doesnt work its becaus your screen is not in 1920X1080 resultion,

use mouse.py to get cordinates and change them in main.py


start mouse.py 
enter the game and wait for it to load

put your mouse over the play button and press f2 once
then over the squad button and press f2 once
then over the AUTO_MATCING check box press f2 once
then enter a game and die
put your mouse over the exit and press f2
then over the ok conifarmation button and press f2

next cause a reconnection problem by entering the game and disconeectiong from the internet
put your mouse over the RECONNECT button in game press f2

exit the game

copy all the cordinates you got from the console to a text file and save it

open main.py in text format (notepad or whatever u got), replace the current cordinates with the one u got (ull see where,ITS VEREY CLEAR)

enjoy
